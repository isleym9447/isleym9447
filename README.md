About me! 

Now for the offical stuffs, 

👋 I’m a final-year IT student at Fayetteville Technical Community College, originally from California. 
I love storytelling through D&D, LARPing, and cosplay, and in my free time you’ll find me gaming, baking, or at the gym. 

Technically, I work with Python, Java, HTML, Linux, cloud tools, and networking.
Im always looking for new ways to blend creativity with tech!
