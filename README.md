About me! 

Now for the offical stuffs, 

👋 I’m a final-year IT student at Fayetteville Technical Community College, originally from California. Technologically, I work with Python, Java, C++, HTML, Linux, cloud tools, and networking.
I'm always looking for new ways to blend creativity with tech!


I love storytelling through LARPing, cosplay, and TTRPGs. In my free time you’ll find me gaming, creating a cosplay, baking, or at the gym.
