About me! 

Now for the offical stuffs, 

I’m a last year IT student at Fayetteville Technical Community College. 
Im from California and have a passion for 
creative storytelling, whether through D&D, 
larping, cosplay, or reading. Outside of that, 
I enjoy baking, spending time at the gym, 
and finding balance between creativity 
and personal growth.
